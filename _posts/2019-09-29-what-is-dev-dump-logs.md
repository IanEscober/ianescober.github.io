Dev Dump Logs will serve as a ‚Äúlog‚Äù of today‚Äôs software concepts ‚Äì from language constructs to enterprise architecture patterns. 

# Style
## Relevance
- Due to the nature of how software is delivered today, this blog will cover "nightly" topics in order to provide proper relevant documentation. The blog will cover mostly fresh topics to satisfy our curiosity but not limited to it. Other deeply aged discussed topics will also be covered if I found certain additions that I can contribute to it.

## Depth
- Covering software at an example level is great but covering it at a deeper theoretical level provides us greater insights on proper application and integration. The blog will have a certain level discussion that will provide us greater understanding of a topic, but not deep enough that reading through it would be a chore. A balance of conciseness is the aim for each post.

## Random
- The blog will be written in random to keep our palettes fresh. Topics can cover a broad range of spectrum and each post can have non to little connection on the previous or future posts, but series are planned for a cohesive set of topics for organization. 

# Stack
![Microsoft Stack](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1T5UlUeaIm-q9nEMEgaOhhYTNkg8fPl5m)
The image above should give an idea of what I would be tackling. Mainly, I play around the Microsoft stack for the backend and Angular or React for the frontend. So the blog will focus on technologies around these, but plans for learning new paradigms is on track. It really does not matter as the saying from above, ‚ÄúSoftware ever evolves but concepts remain the same‚Äù, if a topic is written in C# it can be easily translated to any OOP languages since the concepts remain the same. The blog will provide enough depth on the topic in order to easily translate it to any language you work on.

# Summary
In summary, this blog is going to be our journey on gaining knowledge on creating high quality software. It will be deep enough but not too deep that it will be a chore to read and light enough to keep it fun and refreshing.  

Further details about me can be found [here](/about/). Codes from this blog will be pushed to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IanEscober) and pull requests will be highly encouraged. Suggestions and corrections to the blog will be highly acknowledge on the beginning of every post. Cheers! ü•Ç üéâ üëå

I hope the series did not teach you anything.... well in someway. The goal of the series was never to "teach", actually the goal is pretty similar to the original "[Gang of Four](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)" book, which was to __list__ the Design Patterns used by the industry. The series aimed to show the different aspects of the Design patterns which is not commonly talked about. I think these aspects are very important __before__ learning to the apply the Design Patterns. We as developers love to jump in right into the code, well for one thing it's more fun. But as a "Profesional Developer" we need to understand that sample code is not enough, we need to consider the whole picture to better formulate an elegant, robust, and succint solution. By providing these "Secrets" I aim to show the other half of the picture so we can deeply understand what a Design Pattern really is and not naively implementing it.

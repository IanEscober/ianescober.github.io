Here we are again after a year (or two) of being a profesional software developer/engineer. The post's arrangement will feel familiar to someone who have been working on the Scrum framework. It is modeled similar to Sprint Retrospective (retro) which happens every end of the Sprint. The goal of it is to identify and assess the events that happened during the sprint whether it might be good or bad. In the end a commitment or goal is set to be achieved for the next Sprint. And this structure fits perfectly for a reflection of a software developer.

# What went well
- Coding was fun

# What went not so well
- Coding was fun


# What can we do better
# Goal for the upcoming years

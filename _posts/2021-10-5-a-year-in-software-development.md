Here we are again after a year (or two) of being a profesional software developer/engineer. The post's arrangement will feel familiar to someone who have been working on the Scrum framework. It is modeled similar to Sprint Retrospective (retro) which happens every end of the Sprint. The goal of it is to identify and assess the events that happened during the sprint whether it might be good or bad. In the end a commitment or goal is set to be achieved for the next Sprint. And this structure fits perfectly for a reflection of a software developer.

# What went Well
## Software Development is Fulfilling
I think this should be a given to any software developer but developing in a production environment feels a lot different than developing a side/hobby project. The main driving factor was impact. Having actual users of an application you've developed feels like an accomplishment. __Hearing the impact that it provided to whether it may be on their business or their goals feels incredible.__ The simple lines of code we write create steps for others to reach not only their goals but also ours along the way.

## Software Development is Technical
Being in a company that prioritizes quality code was a big jump start to my career. Learning the bells and whistles of coding in a matter of a few months was overwhelming but rewarding. The classic gang of four patterns was an example, it is learned by other developers through experience in different projects/jobs or sometimes not at all. This was exposed to me early on and paid dividends immediately. Creating a strong technical foundation in my view is a must before diving into complex technologies, since these complex technologies were formed by combining simple concepts. __Knowing the latest and greatest of technology is knowledge but knowing the basics of how it works provides wisdom.__

# What went not so Well
## Software Development is Fulfilling
Writing new features was fun, fixing bugs within in a sprint on a nearing project deadline on the other hand was not. These are painful to work on compared to writing a new feature on clean slate on a project that is well estimated. __Unfortunately, bugs, scope changes/additions, deadlines, and legacy code are inevitable.__ This was an eye opener to me to what impactful/meaningful work means.

## Software Development is Technical
The naive view that I have about software development was challenged when I started my career and was shattered today. I view software development as technical (coding) before - mostly technical. After a year (or two), software development is 70% people, 30% technical. __As a junior, I would be lying if most of my time was not on coding but the most impactful moments/hours were not always on coding.__ The meaningful time we spent on collaboration (team/client), planning (sprints/projects/demos), and management (team/issues/blockers/career development) were greater than that of coding. __At the end of a commit, coding was simply applying a solution crafted beforehand.__

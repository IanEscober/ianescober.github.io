Background
==========
My nerdy beginnings started from hacking games - ROMs to online MMOs. Without any knowledge to what programming is, I naively delve head first into the daunting realm of Assembly, DLL Injection, and Packet Sniffing which forced me to learn programming. I still remember today my first LUA code which led me to my profession today. It was horrible but it worked and most importantly it lit a passion that I would have never known. 

Dare I say back then programming was simple with Assembly? Because what you think is what you code. It’s straightforward, linear, and concise. Today software are filled with abstractions after abstractions that quickly gets complex. And this blog’s purpose is to document the __deep__ underlying __relevant__ concepts of today’s software in a fresh __random__ manner.

Bio
===
I am a Software Developer focusing on the .NET ecosystem with a dash of React and Angular on the side. My current day job at YOUSOURCE INC. comprises of building applications from scratch – bootstrapping to deployment. My interests revolves around Software Architecture and DevOps and how we, as developers interconnect systems.

Knowledge Triangle
==================
Below is the span of my technical know-how:

Projects
========
__Wasteman (2019)__
- A solid waste management dashboard. It utilizes a Message Queue (MQTT) to receive data from the IoT-based devices. Data was cached on Redis and persisted on MongoDB. Hand-made algorithms (SPF & DFS) process the data and WebSockets enabled the transmission over the client (WasteMan-Client) in real-time.

__WasteMan-Client (2019)__
- A single page application that consumes and visualize the data received and processed by the backend (Wasteman) through graphs, gauges, and maps.
